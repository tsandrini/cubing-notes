### PLL parity

1. **PLL Parity case 1:**
   This swaps the 2 edges opposite each other.
   Perform the algorithm with Yellow/White on top.

   ```txt
   r2, U2, r2, Uw2, r2, u2
   ```

2. **PLL Parity case 2:**
   This swaps the 2 edges adjacent each other. Perform the algorithm with
   Yellow/White on top.

   ```txt
   (R' U R U' ) r2, U2, r2, Uw2, r2, u2, (U R' U' R )
   ```

### OLL parity

Faulty edge in front. There are also other versions but they are super
annoying to remember.

```txt
Rw U2, X, Rw U2, Rw U2 , Rw' U2, Lw U2, Rw' U2, Rw U2, Rw' U2, Rw'
```
