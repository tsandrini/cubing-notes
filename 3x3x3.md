## CFOP

### PLL

I've learnt CFOP 10years ago when the algorithms were not that optimized and
had few regrips/rotations in them, I might try to relearn some of them.

- **Aa**: `x L2 D2 (L' U' L) D2 (L' U L')`
  - LH version also available
- **Ab**: `x' L2 D2 (L U L') D2 (L U' L)`
  - LH version also available
- **F**: `R' U' F' (R U R' U') R' F (R2 U' R' U') (R U R' U) R`
- **Ga**:
- **Gb**:
- **Gc**: `R2 F2 (R U2 R U2) R' F (R U R' U') R' F R2`
- **Gd**:
- **Ja**: `x R2 F R F' (R U2 r' U) r U2`
  - using tricks <-> `l2 U l' F' (R U2 r' U) r U2`
  - my old one: `y' (R' U L' U2) (R U' R' U2) R L`
    - awkward end and too many regrips
